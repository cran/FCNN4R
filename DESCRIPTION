Description: The FCNN4R package provides an interface to kernel routines
             from the FCNN C++ library. FCNN is based on a completely new
             Artificial Neural Network representation that offers unmatched
             efficiency, modularity, and extensibility. FCNN4R provides
             standard teaching (backpropagation, Rprop) and pruning
             algorithms (minimum magnitude, Optimal Brain Surgeon), but it is
             first and foremost an efficient computational engine. Users
             can easily implement their algorithms by taking advantage
             of fast gradient computing routines, as well as network
             reconstruction functionality (removing weights and redundant
             neurons).
