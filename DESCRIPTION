Description: Provides an interface to kernel routines from the FCNN C++ library.
             FCNN is based on a completely new Artificial Neural Network
             representation that offers unmatched efficiency, modularity,
             and extensibility. FCNN4R provides standard teaching
             (backpropagation, Rprop, simulated annealing) and pruning algorithms
             (minimum magnitude, Optimal Brain Surgeon), but it is first
             and foremost an efficient computational engine. Users can easily
             implement their algorithms by taking advantage of fast gradient
             computing routines, as well as network reconstruction functionality
             (removing weights and redundant neurons).
