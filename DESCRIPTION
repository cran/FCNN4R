Description: Provides an interface to kernel routines from the FCNN C++ library.
    FCNN is based on a completely new Artificial Neural Network representation that
    offers unmatched efficiency, modularity, and extensibility. FCNN4R provides
    standard teaching (backpropagation, Rprop, simulated annealing, stochastic
    gradient) and pruning algorithms (minimum magnitude, Optimal Brain Surgeon),
    but it is first and foremost an efficient computational engine. Users can
    easily implement their algorithms by taking advantage of fast gradient computing
    routines, as well as network reconstruction functionality (removing weights
    and redundant neurons, reordering inputs, merging networks). Networks can be
    exported to C functions in order to integrate them into virtually any software
    solution.
